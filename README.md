# Telco_Customer_Churn_Analysis
## Problem Statement
In the fiercely competitive landscape of modern business, retaining existing customers is crucial for sustained success. This problem statement revolves around conducting a comprehensive customer churn analysis to understand the factors contributing to customer attrition, thereby enabling businesses to develop effective strategies for enhancing customer retention and overall business performance.
